## Blackjack Project

### Overview
In this project, I created a command-line Blackjack card game. The game follows standard Blackjack rules. 

### How to run
* The player is granted a $1000 starting wallet. 
* The player is prompted to either play Blackjack or quit.
* If the player decides to play Blackjack, the game will begin.
* The player is prompted to choose a bet amount.
* The game will follow standard Blackjack rules until either the player or dealer wins.
* If the player runs out of money or decides to quit, the game will end.


### Technologies Used
* Enums
* Java
* Object-Oriented design
* Try / Catch

### Lessons Learned
In this project, I learned how to create enums and incorporate them into a package. I also learned how to better impliment try/catch statements. A big lesson I learned was how to implement game logic into a program.
